# Blender Point Tracker

This project is a Blender addon that allows you to track points in a video using .

The algorithm used to track poitns in the video is BoostTAP under Apache 2 license.

# TODO 

## Priority 

- [ ] Track Backward / Forward


## Bug correction 
- [ ] Set some configuration as : 
    - Range of the video to process
    - Match image sequences below 
    - Show video to process 
- [ ] Can't click on the button if not point selected
 
## Camera calibration
- [ ] Random plot of points around the scene and over time
- [ ] Number of points per frame (for low gpu memory)
- [ ] Automatic camera calibration in the future.
- [ ] Implement camera solving with depth map ? 
- [ ] Project points to 3D with depth map ?
- [ ] Focal length ? 

## AI functionnalities 
- [ ] Dataloader speedup
- [ ] Offline mode (high gpu memory)
- [ ] Backward inference
- [ ] Aspect Ratio
- [X] Load model in TensorRT => ONNX not working.

## UI 
- [ ] Loading bar / real time tracking showing on the video (modal ?)
- [ ] Add guidelines in the panel

## Documentation
- [ ] Write the documentation
- [ ] Add a license
- [ ] Add a README

## Study concurrent
- TrueDepth
- FlaxTrax
